# mortgage-rates
This is a small project I'm experimenting with in order to get more exposure to public facing APIs and more R programming.
I am using similar data in my day job to correlate market trends with the changing mortgage rates.
Standby for more changes and improvements and maybe crazy stuff added to this project later on.
